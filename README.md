# PIEZOELECTRIC-POWER-GENERATION
Foot step power generation is a way to convert the pressure that occurs due to foot steps into useful electricity.

PROJECT DEFINITION : 
To design a system that generates voltage by the human footsteps force. Using non-conventional sources and stores it for usage. The system will have piezoelectric sensors that will convert the measurements of acceleration, force and pressure into electrical signals. It will fully depend on the human footsteps pressure and convert it into useful power.
